This dataset comprises of n=15 individuals who underwent simultaneous MRI-PET imaging. FDG-PET data was acquired using three different radiotracer administration protocols: bolus, constant infusion, and 50% bolus + 50% infusion. n=5 subjects were acquired with each administration protocol. BOLD-fMRI and FDG-PET was acquired while participants viewed a flickering checkerboard stimulus, presented in an embedded block design.
